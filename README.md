# the_ns_bot
National Service is a topic that is widely talked about in /r/Singapore. In fact, there were quite a few posts ([here](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2d1cf8/interest_gaging_a_subreddit_dedicated_to_ns/) and [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/6tupin/is_there_a_subreddit_for_ns/), just to name a few) that called for a new subreddit for NS. There is indeed a /r/NationalServiceSG in the sidebar, but it has less than 200 subs the last time I checked, and there's not a lot of discussion as well. 

So I decided to make an NS bot instead.

This NS bot will post a comment on any NS-related post, using the account /u/camelorange. In this comment, it will link to other NS-related threads that are more popular(either having a lot of points or having a lot of comments). 

Furthermore, if the post is related to NS postings/vocations, it will also link to other vocation-related threads, in addition to the other threads mentioned above. This means that people can look for more information about vocations more efficiently as well.

### Why a comment then? Why not just a Sticky?
Each subreddit has a fixed number of Stickies. I think it's two, and....I also think /r/Singapore has already reached that quota. 

Furthermore, the main target audience are our NSFs, working hard to defend our country. (Thanks bois. The end of the road isn't far. Jia You!!) Since most of them won't be with their computers, they'll spend most of their time on their phones - which means they'll be using Reddit Mobile. Comments are easier to navigate this way - just scroll down to the comment by this bot, click on the link, and voila!

Also, if Reddit Mobile is widely used by NSmen and MRuncles as well (I mean should be lah. Would you use your work computer to look at Reddit? Or prefer to use phone? Got more privacy from prying eyes), then it should be more convenient for them to look through all the popular discussions as well. 

Enjoy!!
