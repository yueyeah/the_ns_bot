# the_ns_bot
This bot will post a link of more popular posts about NS in any NS-related post in /r/singapore.
This makes it more convenient to read on more about NS. It helps pre-enlistees find out more about the rite of passage that they will be
entering, allows those currently serving to find out more about others' experiences, and provides a place for reminiscing/ranting for those
who have served.
